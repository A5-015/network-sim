# network-sim
Final project for the Probability &amp; Statistics (ENGR-UH 2010) course taught at New York University Abu Dhabi.

Given certain constraints, namely number of nodes and a connection budget, networks may evolve differently in terms of degree distribution and connectedness. The degree distribution of such networks can be modeled by different probability distributions. In this project, we compare a random network and a scale-free network to show that the former can be modeled by a Poisson distribution, while the latter can be modeled by a Power Law distribution.
